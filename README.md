_I recently moved all of my personal developent environment configuration over to Nix. Instead of many dot files, there is a `home.nix` and supporting files. Let me know if you have any questions._

# Checklist

1. Add ssh keys

2. [Install Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install/)

3. Sync

   ```
   $ ./sync.sh
   ```

4. Set zsh as default shell
